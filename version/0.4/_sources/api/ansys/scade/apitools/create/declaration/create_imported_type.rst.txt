.. py:function:: create_imported_type(owner, name, path = None, visibility = VK.PUBLIC)

   
   Create an imported named type.

   The type has a name and a definition.

   :Parameters:

           Owner of the type, which is either the model itself or a package.

       **name** : :class:`python:str`
           Name of the type.

       **path** : :obj:`Path`, default: :data:`python:None`
           Path of the file for storing the type. This parameter is ignored if the
           owner is a package. When the path is ``None`` and owner is the model, the
           type is stored in the model's default file.

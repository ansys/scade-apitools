.. py:function:: add_element_to_project(project, element, folder = None, default = True)

   
   Add the file defining the storage element to the project.

   The file is added if and only if it is not already present.
   If the file is present, the ``folder`` and ``default`` parameters
   are ignored.

   * When the ``folder`` parameter is not ``None``, the file is added to the
     folder specified.
   * When the ``default`` parameter is ``True``, the file is added to either the
     "Model Files" or "Separate Files" folder, depending on the nature of the
     storage unit.
   * Otherwise, the file is added to the project as a root element.

   :Parameters:

       **project** : :obj:`std.Project`
           Project to modify.

       **element** : :obj:`suite.StorageELement`
           Element with storage unit to add to the project.
           If the storage unit is not a root element, the added file is
           tagged as ``NONROOT`` for SCADE.

       **folder** : :obj:`std.Folder`, default: :data:`python:None`
           Parent folder of the file to add to the project.

       **default** : :ref:`bool <python:bltin-boolean-values>`, default: :data:`python:True`
           Whether to add the file to one of the default folders
           for SCADE Suite files.

.. py:function:: create_imported_constant(owner, name, type_, path = None, visibility = VK.PUBLIC)

   
   Create an imported constant.

   The constant has a name and a type.

   :Parameters:

       **owner** : :obj:`suite.Package`
           Owner of the type, which is either the model itself or a package.

       **name** : :class:`python:str`
           Name of the constant.

       **type\_** : :obj:`TX`
           Definition of the type expressed as a type tree.

       **path** : :obj:`Path`, default: :data:`python:None`
           Path of the file for storing the constant. This parameter is ignored if
           the owner is a package. When the path is ``None`` and owner is the model,
           the constant is stored in the model's default file.

       **visibility** : :obj:`VK`
           Accessibility of the constant.

   :Returns:

       :obj:`suite.NamedType`
